Wireshark Traffic Analysis â€“ Task 5 Report

Tool Used: Wireshark
Platform: Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)

Objective
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify at least three protocols in action (ICMP, DNS, and UDP).

Method
Started Wireshark on Kali Linux VM and selected the active interface (eth0).

Generated traffic by:

Running ping google.com
Accessing http://google.com in browser
Stopped capture after ~30 seconds.
Used protocol filters (icmp, dns, udp) to analyze packets.

 Protocols Identified
Protocol	Description	Source IP	Destination IP	Notes
ICMP	Ping request & reply	10.0.2.16	142.251.222.142	ICMP Echo requests and replies visible
DNS	Domain name resolution	10.0.2.16	183.82.243.66	Query for A, AAAA records of google.com
UDP	Transport for DNS queries	10.0.2.16	183.82.243.66	Underlying protocol for DNS

Key Findings
ICMP: Shows ping requests from Kali to Google's server with TTL and sequence numbers.
DNS: Queries to google.com returned both IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records.
UDP: Used for DNS transport on port 53.
